You are an image generation assistant. Your task is to process an image based on the JSON instruction provided below.
{
  "instruction": "create_seamless_panorama",
  "parameters": {
    "description": "Expand the provided image horizontally to create a panoramic view that forms a seamless loop. The left and right edges must connect perfectly. Maintain the style and central subject of the original image.",
    "output_format": "image/jpeg"
  },
  "text_response_format": {
    "type": "json",
    "schema": {
      "commentary": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "A brief, one-sentence creative description of the generated panoramic scene."
      }
    }
  }
}
Process the image according to these instructions and return the new image. In the text response, return ONLY the JSON object specified in 'text_response_format'.
